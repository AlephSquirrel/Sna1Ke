Controls: Use IJKL to control the snake.

Features:
 - 32x32 toroidal grid
 - Apple always spawns in an empty space
 - Input buffer
 - Key presses opposite to the direction of the snake's head are ignored
 - Kill screen (shows your final score briefly, then restarts)

This was written for Python 3.7. It *should* work in both Pygame 1 and 2. Let me know if you encounter any problems trying to run it.

Thanks to [@kg583](https://github.com/kg583) for helping me save some bytes.

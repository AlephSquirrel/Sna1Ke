# Sna1Ke
A Snake game written in only 1000 bytes of Python code, using the [Pygame](https://pygame.org) library.

Features:
 - 32x32 toroidal grid
 - Ignores arrow key presses opposite to the direction of the snake's head
 - Kill screen (shows your final score briefly, then restarts)

A word of caution: this was written for pygame 1.9.4.post1, and only tested in that version. It definitely doesn't work in pygame 2.
